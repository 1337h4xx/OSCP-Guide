#### This section is a work in progress, or something of a living document.  The majority of these machines come from the infamous [TJ Null](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview#) list of OSCP like boxes.  I have added a few from others advice as well.  I will continue to update links and lists on my journey to OSCP.
